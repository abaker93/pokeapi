# Drifloon Database

Drifloon Database is a Pokedex app which pulls its data from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). I built this project to be my own Living Dex checklist and database when the options available online didn't meet the requirements I was looking for. It has a lot of fun customization options that make this pokedex truly feel like its your own.

This project was also a chance to dive deep into React development and app design.

## Features

- **Full Pokedex** - the days of 30 open tabs has ended just because you were trying to learn the type, weaknesses, and locations of a single pokemon. Now it's all available in one spot!
- **Customizable UI** - set your favorite pokemon, base color, and choose dark or light modes (set to system by default) to truly customize your experience.
- **Checklists!!!** - my partner pokes fun at me for playing *Spreadsheet: The Game* whenever I start a new RPG. No longer will I need to start a new game by building an overly engineered Google Sheet to track encounters, variations caught, shinies, etc.
